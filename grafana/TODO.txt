Working:

* grafana
* exports correctly to docker, runs as expected
* pretty much just default install
* listen port is configurable and exported

Needed:

* admin password via hab config
* nginx proxy
* template whole default config file
* undo run hook config passing (in favor of above templated config file)
* compile from source rather than rely on pre-built binaries
* prometheus datastore discovery and config

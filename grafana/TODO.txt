Working:

* grafana
* exports correctly to docker, runs as expected
* pretty much just default install

Needed:

* admin password via config
* listen port should be configurable and exported
* nginx proxy
* prometheus datastore discovery and config

Questions:

* leave the default grafana.ini in config/?
* Pass/change some paths in the run hook or back into the config file?  Should be consistent.

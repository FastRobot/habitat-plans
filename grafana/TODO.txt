Working:

* grafana
* exports correctly to docker, runs as expected
* pretty much just default install
* listen port is configurable and exported

Needed:

* admin password via hab config
* nginx proxy
* prometheus datastore discovery and config

Questions:

* leave the default grafana.ini in config/?
* Pass/change config in the run hook or back into the config file?  Should be consistent.
